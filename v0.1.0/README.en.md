##Special Version 0.1.0
[中文版 README](./README.md)

	test data 1000000 tuples, 80 bytes/tuple
	consist of: key  16  bytes,  value  64  bytes

- Insertion speed			``` 328000 tuples/second ```
- Deletion speed			``` 204000 tuples/second ```


It is a non-relational database written in C, which consists of 6 modules, 16 files and has less than 2000 lines of code.

The core parts `btree.c` and `page.c` have less than 800 lines of codes.

Though it does not has the ACID features of a database, it is small,

its syntax is simple, it has excellent speed and supports 10 million level data insertion and deletion.

pear v0.1.0 enables you to get a quick understanding of the architecture of a database and its concrete implementation.

If you are interested in this `special version` of pear,

`git clone https://github.com/UncP/pear.git`

`cd pear/src`

`make && python ../generate_data.py && ./run`

a million tuples of test data will be generated by python script, python 2.7

or >= 3.5. The run script can change the program arguments, `put` represents the

tuples of data to insert, each `put` represents 10000 tuples, `drop` represents the

tuples of data to delete, each `drop` represents 10000 tuples.

Enjoy !
